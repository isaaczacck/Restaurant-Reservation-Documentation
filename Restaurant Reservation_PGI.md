## A. Problem Statement:

This investigation is specifically about improving the booking process for Mr. Samgyup in Camarin, Caloocan. There are several important questions that have appeared as the restaurant attempts to uplift customer experience and make operations more efficient:

1. How can they deliver a smooth and easy-to-understand booking experience for customers using different devices to lessen annoyance and enhance reservations?
   
2. What types of plans can Mr. Samgyup use for correct real-time table management, avoiding problems like too many bookings or not fully using the tables?
 
3. What measures can Mr. Samgyup undertake to ensure stable and trustworthy correspondence about reservations, confirmations, and reminders so as to lessen the instances of no-shows and improve satisfaction among their customers?
 
4. What steps can Mr. Samgyup put in action for safe management of customer information? How will he make sure that services are personalized, yet still comply with privacy laws?
 
5. How can we best arrange the tables to take into account things like size of party, time of reservation and what customers prefer? 

These queries will steer the investigation of personalized tactics to assist Mr. Samgyup in enhancing its system for reservations, management of tables, practices in communication and secure data keeping.
